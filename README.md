# Real-Time_Pothole_Detection

**problem Statement**
Road infrastructure plays a crucial role in economic growth, safety, and mobility. However, poor road conditions, particularly potholes, pose significant challenges, including increased vehicle operating costs, heightened accident risks, and reduced transportation efficiency. Conventional pothole detection methods, such as manual inspections and specialized sensors, are often expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient for large-scale applications.

**Project Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop an automated pothole detection system using a state-of-the-art deep learning model, You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8-seg). This system is designed for real-time object detection and segmentation, enabling effective and scalable road monitoring while integrating seamlessly with maintenance procedures.

**Approach**
**Dataset:** The system uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing annotated images and video data. The dataset covers diverse conditions, including lit/unlit and rainy/sunny scenarios, ensuring robust model training.
**Data Preparation:** To enhance generalization, the dataset underwent augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and brightness adjustments.
**Model:** YOLOv8-seg was chosen for its advanced real-time object detection capabilities. The model was optimized to detect and segment potholes effectively under various real-world conditions.
**Performance Evaluation:** The model demonstrated strong detection capabilities with a fitness score of 0.92 and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.72 for both bounding boxes and masks. The precision-recall curves and low latency confirmed its suitability for real-time applications.
Key Outcomes
**Efficiency:** The system offers real-time monitoring capabilities with low latency and high segmentation accuracy.
**Scalability:** Designed for large-scale road networks, the model can be integrated into existing infrastructure.
**Impact:** By automating pothole detection, the project improves road safety, reduces maintenance costs, and enhances overall infrastructure management.
**Conclusion**
This project showcases how deep learning can revolutionize road monitoring by transforming traditional methods into efficient, cost-effective, and scalable solutions. The proposed system is ready for deployment in real-world scenarios to support smart road management and maintenance operations.
